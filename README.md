# Build-less

This is a way to do web development on an Android or iOS/iPad device.

## iOS/iPadOS with iSH

iSH is an Alpine 32-bit emulator for iOS/iPadOS. You can do all your development in here with Nano, Vim

Install Python 3 & Git

    apk add python3 git
    git clone https://github.com/joseph-montanez/buildless.git
    cd buildness
    ./start/sh

### Why not NodeJS?

Running any node instance already takes around 50MB, a simple python webserver will only consume 17mb.
